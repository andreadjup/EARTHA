<!--First graph-->
        <div style="float: center;" class="HomeComputers">
            <h4>HomeComputers</h4>
            <iframe style="float: center; border: 0; width: 700px; height: 600px; overflow: hidden;" src="Graphs/HomeComputers.html" scrolling="no">
            </iframe>  
            This graph compares growth in general public access to home computers in Norway, 
            Sweden, Netherlands and Poland. The period explored in the study is 2006 to 2018. 
            The study measures percentage of population that have access to home computers.
        </div>

<!-- Second graph-->
        <div style="float: center;" class="Broadband">
            <h4>Broadband</h4>
            <iframe style="float: center; border: 0; width: 700px; height: 600px; overflow: hidden;" src="Graphs/Broadband.html" scrolling="no">
            </iframe>
            This graph compares access to home broadband network in Norway,
            Sweden, Netherlands and Poland in period between 2005 and 2010. 
            The study measures percentage of households that have access to home broadband.
            One can clearly see the correlation in growing numbers of home computers from the 
            graph "HomeComputers" with growing accessibility to broadband network.
        </div>

<!--Third graph-->
        <div style="float: center;" class="Covid19_Italy">
            <h4>Development of Covid19 in Scandinavia vs Italy</h4>
            <iframe style="float: center; border: 0; width: 800px; height: 750px; overflow: hidden;" src="Graphs/Covid19_Italy.html" scrolling="no">
            </iframe>
            This graph illustrates how dramatically worse the situation is in Italy comparing to Scandinavian 
            countries. Italy jumped abruptly up in numbers of cases in the end of February, approx. 10 days 
            before Scandinavia. Since then the numbers were rapidly growing, but it seems that total shutdown 
            of the country is starting to help and as of March 23d the number of confirmed cases per day slowly started to crawl down. 
        </div>

<!--Fourth graph-->
        <div style="float: center;" class="Covid19_Scandinavia">
            <h4>Covid19 in Scandinavia</h4>
            <iframe style="float: center; border: 0; width: 800px; height: 750px; overflow: hidden;" src="Graphs/Covid19_Scandinavia.html" scrolling="no">
            </iframe>
            The peak for all three countries fell between 11th and 15th of March with much lower numbers 
            the following couple of days, probably due to the introduction of stricter quarantine restrictions 
            by the governments. Interestingly, as of March 23d we see the numbers in Norway and Denmark continue 
            to grow while numbers in Sweden seem to be goin down as of date.

<!--Fifth graph-->
        <div style="float: center;" class="HospitalDays">
            <h4>Average number of days spent in the hospital</h4>
            <iframe style="float: center; border: 0; width: 720px; height: 360px; overflow: hidden;" src="Graphs/hospital_days.png" scrolling="no">
            </iframe>
            From the graph one can see that Japan has a significantly higher average of days spent in the 
            hospital than the other countries, with an average of 16 days. Russia also has an average slightly 
            above the rest, with an average of 10 days. The rest of the countries appear to center around an
            average lenght of 6 days spent in the hospital.
        </div>

<!--Sixth graph-->
        <div style="float: center;" class="AlcoholConsumption">
            <h4>Average litres of alcohol per capita</h4>
            <iframe style="float: center; border: 0; width: 936px; height: 360px; overflow: hidden;" src="Graphs/alcohol_consumption.png" scrolling="no">
            </iframe>
            The scatterplot shows the average number of litres of alcohol per capita in a wide range 
            of countries. As shown in the graph, Turkey has a very low average compared to the other 
            countries. Most of the studied countries fall between 8-10 litres of alcohol per capita 
            while Turkey has an average below 2 litres. 
        </div>
        
<br>
<!--Seventh graph-->
        <div style="float: center;" class="ThreatenedSpecies">
            <h4>Percentage of threatened bird, mammal and plant species</h4>
            <iframe style="float: center; border: 0; width: 1080px; height: 508px; overflow: hidden;" src="Graphs/threatened_species.png" scrolling="no">
            </iframe>
            Each country studied has a varying number of threatened species, both mammals, birds and 
            plants. The graph shows the percentage of threatened species calculated from the total number
            of known species in each country. Remarkably, more than 50% of the plant species that exist in 
            France are threatened.
